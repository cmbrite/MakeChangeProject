## Lessons Learned
The main lesson I learned from making this program is that there can be many ways to solve save same problem.
Don't be afraid to try different variable types.
System.out.print can be very helpful in troubleshooting.  
I spent much more time on the five dollar bill and the nickel than I needed to as they both won't have a value of more than 1.
I might have been able to use another method to make the code cleaner.
